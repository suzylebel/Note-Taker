This application is a note taker so the user can create notes and delete as needed. They are stored in a database.





## Tech Used
Node, express.

## Code Breakdown

Everything was pushed into the server.js folder since there was a connection issue with the routes folder for API and HTML. I will update the project and separate the routes as that is "best practice"
